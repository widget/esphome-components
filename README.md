Components I've been working up to enable the [Lilygo T-Watch 2020 V1](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO_TWatch_Library/blob/master/docs/watch_2020_v1.md).
This is not the same as the V2 or V3!

Example YAML will be in a separate repo.

## Detail

The AXP202 controls power lines and battery information on the watch.
The absolute minimum it needs to do for the watch is enable LDO2 at 3.3V to run the backlight.
